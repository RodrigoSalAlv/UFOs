# UFOs_Challenge

## Project Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this the anaysis was, under a source a little different from the usual of code and database, plot the results via web page using code for HTML and JavaScript. JavaScript is nowadays one of the most popular codes all around the world.

## Results
Its very simple to navigate into the web page we build up: 
  -We have a header just entering the page with a very cool image behind and under this header we can see a litttle paragraph with the descrption Dana asked to add

  -Under this section, we can see the most important section: the table together with the filters; this filters will help us to look up into the information we have available into this table

  -To filter the information we only need to write what we want to search into each 'inputbox'. When we write what we want to search. we only press 'Enter' or 'Tab' to see how the table filter the information by itself (IMPORTANT: the code do not accept Uppercase letters, everything needs to be write with lowercase only)
  -We also can combine searches, for example city and shape; city, state and shape; date, state and shape. Doesn't matter the order, the page will return the results as long as the combination exist.

## Summary
There's just a little drawbacks with the desing, for example, the description will always stay fixed, will always remains the same unless we change the code manually. A secondary option to this could be to retrieve different articles from different pages, that could be automatically updated everyday.

Also, the new users have no idea of all the information that the table contains; an improvement here could be to add a droplist for each inputbox in the filters, this can help the users to easily find what they are looking for. This could also help to avoid the restriction of only lowercases to get a correct filter.

Finally, the information dates from the year 2010, too outdated. If this page will be for public use, we can also add a section for, in case someone has any testimony, could add the information to the current table, and help us to increase the quantity of data in the table.
